\begin{abstract}
Large-amplitude electromagnetic fields driven by RF antennas in the tokamak plasma edge induce perturbed 
charge and current densities on fast RF timescales as power is injected to heat the core plasma. However, 
these fields, charges, and currents also give rise to slow (transport-timescale) ponderomotive effects, since 
the time-average of products of fast quantities is nonzero on these longer timescales. Together with the 
conventional $\nabla(|{\bf E}|^{2})$ ponderomotive force associated with nonuniform EM energy density, 
additional force terms dependent on density gradients, species charge signs, collisionality, and incident 
wave polarization arise, and these terms introduce new vorticity, energy, and parallel momentum sources 
to the edge and SOL transport.  We have coupled the Vorpal (FDTD EM+plasma solver) and UEDGE (2D 
edge plasma transport) codes in a manner enabling numerical study of these ponderomotive terms and 
their effects on edge/SOL transport. In NSTX-adjacent scenarios with experimentally realistic plasma 
profiles and antenna parameters, we observe that the ponderomotive contribution to parallel electron 
momentum is significant (comparable to or larger than other edge transport processes) for representative 
RF input power fluxes. We demonstrate that this parallel momentum source drives the transport of density 
away from the region immediately in front of the RF antenna. Further, as the density is reduced, we show 
that the polarization, propagation, and absorption of incident RF waves is accordingly modified, often in 
detrimental (for antenna efficiency and core power coupling) and potentially self-reinforcing ways.  
Because ponderomotive effects scale in magnitude with the antenna input power flux, they become 
increasingly relevant for large, high-RF-power experiments such as ITER (input power flux 
$\sim 1~\mbox{MW/m}^2$), and we consider the implications of these results for ITER antenna operation.
